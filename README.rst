Qboost

The D-Wave quantum computer has been widely studied as a discrete optimization
engine that accepts any problem formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO). In 2008, Google and D-Wave published a paper,
`Training a Binary Classifier with the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0416.pdf>`_, which describes how the Qboost
ensemble method makes binary classification amenable to quantum computing: 
the problem is formulated as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of
weak classifiers and the D-Wave quantum computer is  used to optimize the
weights in a learning process that strives to minimize the training error
and number of weak classifiers

This code demonstrates the use of the D-Wave system to solve a binary
classification problem using the Qboost algorithm.
